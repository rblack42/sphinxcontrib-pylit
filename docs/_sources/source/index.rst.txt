The |pylit| Sphinx_extension
============================

The **sphinxcontrib-pylit** package is a Sphinx_ extension providing a
**domain** with several new directives that support |LP|. It also provides a
command-line interface for manipulating the code documented in |RST| files.
This section contains auto-generated documentation produced by the Sphinx_
**autodoc** tools. Notes found here should help in navigating the source code.
To understand the overall design of this software refer to :ref:`develop`.
