Introduction
============

..  include::   /references.inc

This is the documentation for the |pylit| extension for Sphinx_.

This extension provides support for ia variation of Dr. Donald Knuth's |LP| concepts, extended
to also support generation of Git_ code repositories from the documentation.
This tool was written to support generation of lecture materials for Computer
Science courses the author taught.

..	note::

    There are several packages listed on PyPi_ with **pylit** in the name. I
    first used this name in 2003 as part of my Computer Science Master's Thesis
    project at Texas State Uniersity, and I registered the **pylit.org** name
    in 2005 :cite:`black:2005`. If this causes confusion, I apologize to the others trying to
    build similar systems.

Prerequisites
-------------

Sphinx needs at least **Python 3.5** to run.  It also depends on 3rd party
libraries such as docutils_ and jinja2_, but they are automatically installed
when sphinx is installed.


Usage
-----

See :doc:`/usage/quickstart` for an introduction.  It also contains links to
more advanced sections in this manual for the topics it discusses.
