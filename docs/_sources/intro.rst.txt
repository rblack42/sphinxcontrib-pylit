Introduction
============

..  include::   /references.inc

This is the documentation for the |pylit| extension for Sphinx_.

This extension provides support for ia variation of Dr. Donald Knuth's |LP| concepts, extended
to also support generation of Git_ code repositories from the documentation.
This tool was written to support generation of lecture materials for Computer
Science courses the author taught.

..  note::

    The name **pylit** is listed on pypi_ for another unrelated project.  The
    author first used this name for aprogram written at Texas State University
    for a Computer Science Master's thesis project in 2003. Sorry for any
    confusion that may cause here.

Prerequisites
-------------

Sphinx needs at least **Python 3.5** to run.  It also depends on 3rd party
libraries such as docutils_ and jinja2_, but they are automatically installed
when sphinx is installed.


Usage
-----

See :doc:`/usage/quickstart` for an introduction.  It also contains links to
more advanced sections in this manual for the topics it discusses.
